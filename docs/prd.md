# Product Requirements Document: pg-capture

## Executive Summary

pg-capture is a high-performance Change Data Capture (CDC) solution that streams PostgreSQL database changes to Apache Kafka in real-time. Built in Rust for reliability and performance, it enables organizations to build event-driven architectures, maintain data synchronization across systems, and implement audit trails with minimal impact on source databases.

## Problem Statement

Organizations need to:
- Capture database changes in real-time without impacting OLTP performance
- Stream changes to multiple downstream systems and data lakes
- Build event-driven architectures based on database state changes
- Maintain audit trails and implement CQRS patterns
- Enable real-time analytics and reporting

Current solutions often suffer from:
- High latency and performance overhead
- Complex setup and maintenance requirements
- Limited reliability and error recovery capabilities
- Lack of observability and monitoring features

## Solution Overview

pg-capture provides a lightweight, reliable bridge between PostgreSQL's logical replication protocol and Apache Kafka, enabling:
- Real-time streaming of INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations
- Exactly-once delivery semantics with configurable guarantees
- Automatic schema evolution handling
- Built-in monitoring and observability
- Simple configuration and deployment
